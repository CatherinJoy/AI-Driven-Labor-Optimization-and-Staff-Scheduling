# AI-Driven-Labor-Optimization-and-Staff-Scheduling

The project uses advanced data analytics and predictive modeling approaches to optimize personnel management, scheduling, and sales forecasting. The study use models like LSTM and XGBoost to forecast future sales by gathering comprehensive employee skill set and availability data in addition to three years' worth of daily sales data. The results show that LSTM is the most accurate method. Average labor hours per unit, role-specific characteristics, and day-of-week variances are all taken into account when converting the projected sales into labor demand. Bayesian inference and heuristic approaches are used to automate scheduling with the help of these labor demand forecasts. This combination enables the system to provide dynamic schedule modifications based on probabilistic reasoning, taking into account role-specific needs and staff availability limits. The system has an intuitive user interface created in collaboration with Streamlit, including features like automatic scheduling, staff management, and sales forecasting. Users may effectively manage their personnel, make data-driven choices, and improve operational efficiency with the help of this interface.
